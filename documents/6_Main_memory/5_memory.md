The CEP's main memory had, in its first iteration, $4096$ memory cells, which were later incremeted to $8192$.[[7](./0_reference.md)]

The computer is attached to a magnetic drum and an output printer. 

<!-- paper 1964-IS-001 tells the desire to attach the computer to a magnetic tape unit, but I have no clear evidence if it was truly attached. -->
