## External Devices[[2]](./0_reference.md)
The CEP's external components are:

- **Drum Memory(*tamburo* in italian)**: external data storage using punched tape (*nastri magnetici* in italian) for loading data and programs onto the CEP's main memory.

- **Photoelectric sensor (*lettori fotoelettrici* in italian)**: A photoelectric sensor is a device used to determine the distance, absence, or presence of an object by using a light transmitter, often infrared, and a photoelectric receiver. 
<!-- I am still not clear on what the CEP could do with it -->

- **Parallel Printer (*stampante in parallelo* in italian)**: a device.
<!-- I am still not sure on what it is. -->

- **Perforatori veloci**: **NOT CONFIRMED, THIS IS MY THEORY**: used for writing punched tape for storing data or programs produced by the CEP.

- **Teleprinter (*telescriventi* in italian)**: used to send and receive text messages over a a telegraphy network.
