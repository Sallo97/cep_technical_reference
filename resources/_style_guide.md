    Style guide:
    All multimedia resources which are not passed through hyperlinks must be stored in the `resource` directory. As of now, since it consists of only images, there is no distinction. 
    
    If other type of files (e.g. audio, video, example source code, etc...) is added, then they should be stored in their own subdirectory (e.g. the subdirectory `image` will contain all the image files).

    Images' names must use only lowercase letters and follow the snake_case convention. They must be short, using at most three words. 
    
    Images referring explicitly to the cep must start with the `cep` prefix.

    It is preferred to use redrawn .svg images instead of screenshots, scans or downloaded pictures.
